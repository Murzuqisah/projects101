# ASCII-ART

***


*Project is maintained by me*

+ This project is written in Go language.

* The project uses standard Go packages.

+ Test files are meant to test the functionality of the project to ensure flawless operation of the functions

+ Ascii-art is a program which consists in receiving a string as an argument and outputting the string in a graphic representation using ASCII. It's Time to Write Big.

+ You can use [shadow](https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/ascii-art/shadow.txt) ascii-art, [standard](https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/ascii-art/standard.txt) ascii-art, or [thinkertoy](https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/ascii-art/thinkertoy.txt) ascii-art to print out the commandline arguments.

## Usage

+ Command-line arguments are written as follows:

```bash 
go run . "example"
```


+ This project handles an input with numbers, letters, spaces, special characters and \n(new-lines).

* To know the range of ASCII characters, you can enter the following command in your terminal

```bash
man ascii
```
* man is short for manual. The command above will display a manual for ASCII characters when it runs.

+ The ASCII characters considered in this case range from ASCII character index 32 to index 126

## BANNER FORMAT *

>> Each character has a height of 8 lines

>> Characters are separated by a newline (\n)
